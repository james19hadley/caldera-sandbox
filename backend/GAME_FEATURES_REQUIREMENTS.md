### Harmonic Landscape Resonance Puzzle
**Inspired by Outer Wilds' musical mechanics**

**Core Concept:**
- **Pseudorandom meridian lines** traverse the sandbox like energy fields
- **Each meridian** generates musical frequencies based on terrain elevation
- **Mathematical interference patterns** create visual and auditory harmony/discord
- **Goal:** Manipulate terrain to achieve perfect harmonic convergence

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- **Terrain height directly controls musical pitch** - higher sand = higher notes
- **Meridian intersections** create harmonic intervals (octaves, fifths, thirds)
- **Visual feedback:** Harmonic alignment produces beautiful geometric patterns
- **Audio feedback:** Perfect tuning creates Outer Wilds-style ethereal melodies
- **Mathematical constraints** prevent trivial solutions - perfect flattening impossible

**Progressive Complexity:**
1. **Beginner:** 2 meridians, simple octave harmony (2:1 ratio)
2. **Intermediate:** 3+ meridians, major/minor chords, complex timing
3. **Advanced:** Moving meridians with temporal patterns
4. **Master:** 3D standing wave interference, multiple harmonic layers

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Fourier transforms** convert terrain topology to frequency domain
- **Real-time audio synthesis** based on harmonic ratios
- **Procedural pattern generation** for visual interference effects
- **Physics-based resonance** simulation for authentic wave behavior

**Outer Wilds Travelers Inspiration:**
- Multiple "musician meridians" like different band members (Traveler instruments)
- **Harmonic convergence moment** when all frequencies align perfectly
- **Exploration element** - discovering hidden mathematical relationships
- **Meditative gameplay** - no time pressure, pure pattern recognition
- **Audio tracks:** For non-commercial open-source release, reference Outer Wilds Travelers music
- **Repository resource:** https://github.com/jasondyoungberg/travelers/tree/main/resources

**Why Perfect for Sandbox:**

- **Smooth wave interference** - flowing, organic curve patterns  
- **Ethereal color gradients** - soft blues, purples, and gentle glows
- **Synchronized meridian pulses** - all lines breathing in unison
- **Mandala-like convergence** - symmetric, centered, peaceful patterns

**Meridian Movement Patterns:**

**Option 1: Rotating Meridians**
- Meridians slowly rotate around sandbox center point
- Perfect alignment creates geometric star/flower patterns
